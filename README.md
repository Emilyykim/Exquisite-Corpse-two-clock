## Briefs for each stage

### 游댮 Stage 1
Create a sketch that shows an unconventional representation of time. This 'clock' should be constantly changing, but its appearance can repeat in a subsequent cycle. It does not need to follow a 24-hour cycle (you can use any timescale). Give your sketch a unique title and edit the README file accordingly.

### 游리 Stage 2
Respond to a Stage 1 sketch that you've chosen by using interactivity. You can either add to the chosen sketch or build a new one from scratch (this applies for all subsequent stages too).

### 游릭 Stage 3
Find or construct a dataset that relates to the sketch you've inherited. Incorporate visualisations of the dataset into your response to the Stage 2 sketch.

### 游댯 Stage 4
Adapt a Stage 3 sketch into a text-based game. There should be different pathways through the game. Images (still or moving) can accompany the words (but this is not required).

### 游릮 Stage 5
Reimagine something from a Stage 4 sketch as a living entity or an environment.

 # Chromatic Clock

This project is a unique representation of time using a color-changing background. The clock runs on a 10-second cycle, where the hue of the background changes from 0 to 360 degrees on the HSB colour scale. This visual change gives an unconventional yet constant sense of time passing.

## Instructions

- Clone the repository.
- Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the clock.

## Concept

Time is often perceived through changes in our environment. This clock visualizes time through continuous and smooth colour transitions, creating a new way to experience the passage of seconds.

# Celestial Clock

This project presents an unconventional representation of time using a dynamic display of celestial images and star patterns. The "Celestial Clock" uses a continuous cycle to display images of nebulae, black holes, and supernovas, interspersed with randomly appearing stars, to create a constantly changing visual experience.

## Instructions

- Clone the repository.
- Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the clock.

## Concept

The passage of time is represented through the changing and moving images of celestial objects, reflecting the ongoing cycles and transformations in the universe. Adding a starry background that evolves emphasizes the dynamic nature of space.

## Changes from Inherited Work

- Maintained the sequential display of celestial images.
- Added animated horizontal movement for images.
- Introduced a trailing effect for a more dynamic background.
- Modified star drawing to occur consistently, enhancing the visual experience.
- Enhanced image display logic to include motion and direction changes.
